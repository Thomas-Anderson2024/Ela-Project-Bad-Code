        “You can’t build a house without nails and wood. If you don’t want a
        house built, hide the nails and wood.” -Beatty pg 64. You can’t gain
        knowledge (new information) without a source. But if you don’t have
        those sources(books) then human knowledge won’t increase and come to a
        degree that is considered dangerous.

        maintained throughout. Anything that interferes with the goals of

        “A book is a loaded gun in the house next door.” -Beatty pg 62 Books can
        display the knowledge that explodes into an irreversible event that
        changes humanity. Connection between a loaded gun to a book full of
        knowledge: the consequences/aftermath/effects of using a gun results
        change in people’s life equals the change the information in a book can
        bring, small or big, to lives and society. Books are a time ticking
        bomb, once opened/read new opinions rises and actions are performed.
