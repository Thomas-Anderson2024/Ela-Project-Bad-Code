        Burning Babel connects to Farenheit 451 because in our prequel, Burning
        Babel, NERV is burning books and scrambling humans’ minds through the
        usage of technology making them dumber and more ignorant, preventing
        them to learn about immortality and “blasphemous” knowledge (knowledge
        going against god).

        In Fahrenheit 451, the firefighters continue to burn books and the
        houses that have books inside. Their world is also consumed by
        technology feeding them mindless information to keep them ignorant and
        thoughtless. Seldom are aware that a religious organization are behind
        this, due to the brainwashing.

        Very few people, such as Faber and Montag, are suspicious that there is
        a motive behind the burning of books, but are not sure who are truly
        behind it.
