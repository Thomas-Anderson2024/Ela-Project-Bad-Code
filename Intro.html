      <li>
        Our prequel is founded off of the idea that a religious organization,
        NERV, has achieved control over the flow of knowledge. By taking over
        the digital space, NERV has begun brainwashing humans to become
        uninspired, lackluster, and dumb.
      </li>
      <li>
        NERV now needs control over physical knowledge. This all stemmed from
        one professor. In the pursuit of knowledge, he has discovered
        blasphemous power.
      </li>
      <li>
        As more books were made public, knowledge begins to stack exponentially.
        The professor doing independant research believes that what he found
        should be forbidden; Immortality and omnipotence.
      </li>
      <li>
        He attempts to burn his work, but this does not solve the issue, so
        using religious reasoning the professor gathers a large following.
      </li>
      <li>
        As time progresses, the group changes leadership and corrupts, NERV
        starts to control the flow of information throughout the world, mainly
        by burning the information.
