    <ul class="BulletList">
      <li>
        In the book of genesis, The Tower of Babel was formed by a united human
        race following the great flood. Speaking one language, they agree to
        construct a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven.
      </li>
      <li>
        God sees this as blasphemous, and is concerned that all of this human
        potential without constraint could lead to human resistance against a
        second flood. God confounds their language, and scatters them around the
        world to prevent this.
      </li>
      <li>
        This relates to our story because like the humans, through knowledge and
        books, we kept getting closer and closer to heaven, or godhood. And
        similar to god, NERV does not want this to transpire.
      </li>
      <li>
        The human race in fahrenheit 451 becomes scattered, dumb, mediocre, and
        ignorant. It is important to remember that The Tower of Babel is not an
        event in our book, but it is the concept of it that is similar to the
        events transpiring in the prequel.
