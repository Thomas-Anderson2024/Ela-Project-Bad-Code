    <ul class="BulletList">
      <li>
        No one ever reaches vitality. Vitality means good health, a state of
        being strong and active. The NERV group that causes the events of
        Fahrenheit 451 does not believe humans should be able to reach this, no
        one should reach strong and healthy thinking, instead, they make them
        dumb, and the opposite of vitality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Originally founded in order to keep society from collapsing, time has
        ruined these intentions and now complete control of knowledge is
        desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        The organization originated as a final line between humanity and
        blasphemy, but as time progressed leaders became obsessed with world
        ruling and escalated their boundaries.
      </li>
      <li>
        The general populous becomes weak, feeble minded, dumb, and ignorant.
        Similar to god, NERV almost fears what humans are capable of with books.
